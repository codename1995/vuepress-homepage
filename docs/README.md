## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/), supervised by [Prof. dr. Theo Gevers](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/th.gevers/). Also, I am so fortunate to have the opportunity of discussing research problems with [Dr. Fatemeh Karimi Nejadasl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkariminejadasl/) and [Deyvid Kochanov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deyvid-kochanov-688ba610b/) from [TOMTOM](https://www.tomtom.com/nl_nl/). Before that, I obtained my Master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. dr. Zhi Liu](http://www.ivp.shu.edu.cn/).

I focus on **point cloud** and **semantic segmentation**. I also have a background in other computer vision fields, including visual attention modeling, saliency prediction and object segmentation.

## News

- **[04/2021]** I join in the [ATLAS Lab](https://icai.ai/atlas-lab/) and settle in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
- **[02/2021]** One paper got accepted to Signal processing: Image communication.
- **[10/2020]** I am granted the **National Scholarship**.
- **[06/2020]** One paper got accepted to Neurocomputing.
- **[07/2019]** Won the winner award of [Saliency4ASD](https://saliency4asd.ls2n.fr/) (Grand Challenge of ICME 2019)

## Projects


[â†’ Full list](/projects/)

<ProjectCard image="/projects/1.png" hideBorder=true>

  **The Making of Harry Potter's Wand**

  Harry P., Hermione G., *et al*
  
  Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Usually the repair of a wand is impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.

  **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows**
  
  In the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, which is set 19 years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Ginny are a couple and have three children: James Sirius Potter, who has already been at Hogwarts for at least one year, Albus Severus Potter, who is starting his first year there, and Lily Luna Potter, who is two years away from her first year at the school.
